# Automotive Software Concepts Year One Project

I created this project during my second semester of Applied Computing. 
The Automotive Software Concepts module required us to conceptualize, 
design, and implement an embedded system using an Arduino board.

I designed my system to replicate that of a Formula 1 safety car's
onboard warning light system. I am a keen fan of F1 and enjoyed this 
project quite a bit. I am pleased with the resulting system and 
appreciate the challenge it presented.

The project document .pdf can be read for greater detail regarding the 
project goals and design process. The system can be replicated using 
tinkercad.com, again by consulting the project document .pdf.
